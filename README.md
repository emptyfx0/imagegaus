# imagegaus

This program implements an image gaussian filter and HSV color filter 

### a Gaussian filter

A Gaussian Filter is a low pass filter used for reducing noise (high frequency components) and blurring regions of an image. The filter is implemented as an Odd sized Symmetric Kernel (DIP version of a Matrix) which is passed through each pixel of the Region of Interest to get the desired effect. The kernel is not hard towards drastic color changed (edges) due to it the pixels towards the center of the kernel having more weightage towards the final value then the periphery. A Gaussian Filter could be considered as an approximation of the Gaussian Function (mathematics).

### HSV

HSL (for hue, saturation, lightness) and HSV (for hue, saturation, value; also known as HSB, for hue, saturation, brightness) are alternative representations of the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives color-making attributes. In these models, colors of each hue are arranged in a radial slice, around a central axis of neutral colors which ranges from black at the bottom to white at the top.

The HSL representation models the way different paints mix together to create color in the real world, with the lightness dimension resembling the varying amounts of black or white paint in the mixture (e.g. to create "light red", a red pigment can be mixed with white paint; this white paint corresponds to a high "lightness" value in the HSL representation). Fully saturated colors are placed around a circle at a lightness value of Â½, with a lightness value of 0 or 1 corresponding to fully black or white, respectively.

The HSV representation models how colors appear under light. The difference between HSL and HSV is that a color with maximum lightness in HSL is pure white, but a color with maximum value/brightness in HSV is analogous to shining a white light on a colored object (e.g. shining a bright white light on a red object causes the object to still appear red, just brighter and more intense, while shining a dim light on a red object causes the object to appear darker and less bright).
